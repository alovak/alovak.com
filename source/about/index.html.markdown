title: About Me
---
Since 2006, I have worked in fintech, focusing on payment processing, card networks, and tokenization. Currently, Iâ€™m an engineer working with [Moov Financial](https://moov.io) on card processing projects.

In 2015, I joined [my friend](https://yaz.in/) as a CTO to build [White Payments](https://whitepayments.com/), a payment processing company that was later acquired by Payfort and subsequently by Amazon, where it all evolved into what is now [Amazon Payment Services](https://paymentservices.amazon.com).

Later, I jouned my friend to built [Verify Payments](https://verifypayments.com/), an embedded payments solution designed to streamline payment acceptance using bank accounts for businesses in the Middle East.

## Open Source Projects

* [iso8583](https://github.com/moov-io/iso8583/) and [iso8583-connection](https://github.com/moov-io/iso8583-connection) Golang packages used by companies such as [MoovFinancial](https://moov.io), [ThoughtMachine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/), [Qonto](https://qonto.com/en), and [MercadoLibre](https://mercadolibre.com/), for card network integrations on the acquiring and issuing sides.
* [vaulty](https://vaulty.co) is a data tokenization and encryption proxy. While no longer actively maintained, it remains a valuable resource for developers looking for ideas on implementing data tokenization and encryption techniques.
