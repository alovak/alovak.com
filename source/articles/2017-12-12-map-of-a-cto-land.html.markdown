I'm continuously looking for an information to draw my map of a CTO land. So far I have found 3 big parts of it: Culture, Technology and Operations. READMORE


## Culture

I know that people are the key to success or failure for any project. Thus, Culture is the main area I should pay attention to.

Culture includes different things: values, rules, behaviors, norms, traditions, relations. Culture is how you work together, how you communicate, how you learn and share, how you talk about each other, how you discuss and solve problems.

## Technology

Technology is all about programming languages, frameworks, data, infrastructure, security, scalability and so on. For me, it means that I have to be at least familiar with mentioned things. The smaller startup the more I should know and do myself. When a company grew it's impossible to cover all areas, but it's essential that I understand, learn, experiment with them all the time.

What about writing code? I do prototyping, testing new solutions, writing proof-of-concept code, trying out a major refactoring just to see if it works â€” these things make sense, and they allow me to both perform my regular duties and keep in touch with code/technology.

##Operations

Operations are about how and how well we do and deliver things. It's about portfolio/project/product management, processes, collecting data and metrics, measure and report results, implement improvements.

In my practice, it's usually adding transparency and visibility to processes and data. Like a scrum/kanban boards, displays with metrics, etc.

I'm going to focus on this three areas in the nearest time in a sense of learning and doing. Having a map helps me move forward with less fear and more energy.
