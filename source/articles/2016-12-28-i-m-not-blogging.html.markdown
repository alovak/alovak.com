I have tried blogging multiple times. But without success. It's difficult for me
to be sustainable in writing. I have many reasons to not write. For instance...

## I don't have anything to share now.

Frankly, I don't believe that I don't have topics to write about. But it's really hard
to stop and think about things I can share or things I can make notes for.
Sometimes I just call my friends and discuss some topic that worries me and this
helps me to sort my thoughs and ideas in my head. No need in sharing then.

## It's hard to write in English

Maybe it was a reasonable reason. But now I'm not spending hours trying to build
sentences or trying to find what is the tense I have to apply here. I just type and don't care too much about it anymore. The main goal is to be understood. Also, I have reaslized that writing is a missing part in my language learning.

## It's hard to write and be right

I've noticed that if you have an opinion on some subject or believe in something
then you should talk about it carefully. I mean that it can be wrong or not
applicable for someone. Or someone has problems with this. So I started to think
in neutral words and terms and after this all colors and energy dissapear from what I want to share.

Or... Next week I will change my mind on the topic. Ha-ha.

But. I will try one more time. Because I see value in trying :)
